#### What is FDE.AI?
FeraDroid Engine (FDE) - an All-in-One ultimate optimizer for all devices running Android OS. All parameters are individual for EVERY device depending on it's hardware/software characteristics. All parameters are very balanced - you may gain performance without increase of power consumption AND reduce power consumption without losing performance. FDE.AI is totally compatible with very wide range of devices and Android OS versions. Very wide-range settings of OS and Linux kernel are configured, still being cross-platform utility, maximally compatible with all devices. FDE.AI applies configurations depending on hardware and software of device, so that in the end every device is configured individually. All applied changes are systemless (system partition is not touched). Some app features may not be supported on various CPUs/kernels. Root and Shizuku (non-root) modes are supported.<br><br>
